# Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for Burton Equation Parameter Estimation

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) designed to model geomagnetic storms (specifically the SMR SuperMAG index) and estimate the physical parameters of the Burton equation.

The model simultaneously learns the solution to the differential equation and identifies the unknown physical parameters: the decay time ($\tau$) and the solar wind coupling coefficient ($a$).

## Scientific Context

The project models the evolution of the ring current using the **Burton Equation**:

$$\frac{dSMR}{dt} = a \cdot q(t) - \frac{SMR}{\tau}$$

Where:
* $SMR$ is the SuperMAG index.
* $q(t)$ is the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling function.
* $a$ is the injection efficiency parameter.
* $\tau$ (tau) is the ring current decay time.

### Key Features
* **Hard Constraints:** Implements initial condition enforcement via ansatz $u(t) = u_0 + \tanh(t-t_0) \cdot \mathcal{N}(t)$.
* **Adaptive Loss Balancing:** Uses a learnable Lagrange multiplier ($\lambda$) to automatically balance data loss and physics residuals during training.
* **RK45 Validation:** Automatically validates learned parameters by solving the ODE with a standard Runge-Kutta (RK45) solver and comparing it to the PINN prediction and observed data.
* **Ensemble Training:** Supports training multiple ensemble members with different seeds to quantify uncertainty.

## Requirements

* **Python Version:** Developed and tested using Python 3.10.12 (o la tua versione esatta).
* **Environment:** It is recommended to use a virtual environment or a Conda environment.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/pinn-burton-storm.git](https://github.com/your-username/pinn-burton-storm.git)
    cd pinn-burton-storm
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Data Availability

This repository does not include the raw data due to redistribution policies. To run the experiments, you need to:

1.  **Solar Wind Data (OMNI):** Downloaded from [NASA CDAWeb](https://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/).
2.  **Geomagnetic Indices (SuperMAG):** Obtain a free account and download the SMR index from [SuperMAG](https://supermag.jhuapl.edu/).
3.  **Setup:** Place the downloaded CSV files in a `data/` folder and update the `file_path` in `src/config.py`.

## Configuration

All hyperparameters are centralized in `src/config.py`. You can modify the following key settings:

  * **Data Paths:** Update `file_path` to point to your OMNI/SuperMag CSV file.
  * **Physics:** Change `y_col` (target) and `q_col` (driver).
  * **Training:** Adjust `train_steps`, `lrate`, and `patience`.
  * **Architecture:** Modify `layer_sizes` or `n_rff` (Random Fourier Features).

## Usage

To train the model on a specific solar wind driver (e.g., `vBs`), run:

```bash
python main.py
```

By default, the script in `main.py` iterates over a list of drivers defined in the `__main__` block.

### Output

Results are saved in the `results/` directory, organized by driver and storm ID:

  * `plots/`: Visualization of the time series fit, parameter evolution ($\tau, a$), and loss curves.
  * `history/`: CSV files containing the training history for each ensemble member.
  * `checkpoints/`: PyTorch model states (`.pth`) for the best performing epoch.

## Methodology Visualization

The training process produces a composite plot for validation:

1.  **Fit vs Observations:** Compares Ground Truth, PINN prediction, and RK45 integration (using learned params).
2.  **Loss Components:** Tracks Data Loss vs. Weighted Physics Loss.
3.  **Parameter Recovery:** Shows the convergence of $\tau$ and $a$ over training steps.
